## What I have learned

The initial project was created during a "hacking day" so I learned to create a small app from scratch and stick to a MVP. The biggest "chunk" was to go through the huge documentation of the Google Maps API: it was a nice exercise to practice reading technical documentation :)

## What's next to do?

- add an admin page (with authentication) to create, update and delete locations
- write more React tests
- play with React Router a little bit
- improve the UI (especially in terms of accessibility, hover states)
- improve copywriting (maybe add some pictures)
- oh and I'd love for the user to be able to have an account and save their favorite locations!!
